# Tech-Blog

## Purpose
To build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. 
This application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as its templating language, uses Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for user authentication.
